The main characters are Levi (Miles Teller), a former Marine and elite sniper, and Drasa (Anya Taylor-Joy), a Lithuanian sniper in the service of Moscow. 
They are tasked by an unnamed organization: to guard opposite sides of a mysterious gorge that hides an unknown danger in its fog. Their mission is to patrol the area, maintain automatic machine guns and mine barriers, preventing the exit of mysterious creatures known as “hollow men”. 
Contact between them is strictly forbidden, but loneliness and curiosity lead Levi and Drasa to begin communicating through signs and binoculars, gradually developing romantic feelings. 
Their bond becomes the only bright spot in a dark and dangerous environment. However, when the creatures from the gorge begin active attacks, the heroes have to join forces to survive and prevent a global catastrophe. 
In the process, they uncover the secrets of a mysterious laboratory at the bottom of the gorge where experiments were conducted to create super soldiers, which leads to unexpected and dramatic consequences.

The Gorge Mo𝚟ie 𝚛𝚎𝚟𝚒𝚎𝚠:  
Scott Derrickson, master of atmospheric thrillers and mystical dramas, revisits the theme of irrational horror in The Ravine, this time set in the context of the Cold War. The film is mesmerizing in its visual power, but gets lost in a maze of genre ambitions, never finding its way to depth. It is a story of how a spectacular metaphor - the abyss as a symbol of fear of the unknown - turns into a setting for superficial action, where emotions are replaced by melodrama and intrigue dissolves in special effects.  

The idea behind “The Gorge” is deceptively simple: in a secret zone on the border of the USSR and the West, an anomaly is discovered - a deep crevice hiding something inexplicable for more than half a century, and the crevice is being watched by two operatives from opposing camps. This plot framework, reminiscent of a hybrid of Tarkovsky's “Stalker” and “A Quiet Place,” could have been the basis for a philosophical statement about the nature of fear, the limits of trust, and the price of blind enmity. Alas, instead, the viewer gets a kaleidoscope of genre stamps: there are creatures from the gorge, a love line against the background of the apocalypse, and a race against the clock with formulaic dialogues.  
Visually, Derrickson remains true to himself: cameraman Dan Laustsen, whose work for “John Wick” and “The Shape of Water” became a benchmark of style, turns the gorge into a living organism. The fog enveloping the rocks in a shimmering shroud, the glare of flashlights catching the creatures' outlines out of the darkness, the contrast between the claustrophobia of the dungeons and the cold emptiness of the military base - the shot breathes, pulsates, hypnotizes. The design of the creatures, combining biomechanical elements with an almost gothic aesthetic, references Guillermo del Toro's best work.  

Behind this beauty, however, is an emptiness.  

The main problem with “The Ravine” is not the lack of ideas, but the inability to develop them. Zack Dean's script resembles a draft of a genius who decided to shoot it before editing. The first 30 minutes are drowned in exposition: dialogues about the “importance of the mission”, hints of past tragedies, a portrait of a dead colleague on the wall of the bunker. When the action finally shifts to the gorge, the narrative begins to flounder. Key revelations (the origin of the anomaly, the creatures' connection to the Cold War) occur not only ahead of time, but also in random lines, as if the screenwriter was in a hurry to get to the action.  

The love line between Levi (Miles Teller) and Drassa (Anya Taylor-Joy) is a separate source of frustration. Their romance develops according to the Hollywood template, but the script doesn't let the viewer believe in this transformation. Instead of a gradual rapprochement, there is a leap from mutual barbs to embraces by the fire; instead of internal conflicts, there are pathos phrases.
The historical context in “The Gorge” is nothing more than a backdrop for the chase. The ideological confrontation between superpowers, the fear of nuclear threat, the psychology of people living in perpetual tension - all of these could have enriched the story by adding layers of metaphors. Instead, the script reduces the confrontation to personal ambition and the banal origin story of the gorge.  

The anomaly itself, which was awe-inspiring in its mysteriousness in the first frames, turns into a set of CGI tricks by the finale. Yes, the creatures are scary at times, their appearance is filmed masterfully, but their nature remains undisclosed. Especially frustrating are the moments where potential is lost in favor of spectacle.  

“The Gorge” is like a perfectly shot trailer for a movie that doesn't exist. It has everything to succeed: a stellar cast, a great idea, and a director who has proven his talent in “Sinister” and “Dr. Strange.” But underneath the shell is a vacuum.

Derrickson, who has always been able to balance the mass market and the auteur, has lost the battle with the studio this time. “The Ravine” wants to be and intellectual horror, and romantic melodrama, and blockbuster, but in the end still does not decide on which side of the abyss to stay.  

For those looking for “darkness and screams,” a light version of “Aliens,” or an evening backdrop for popcorn, this will do. For those who remember how the same Derrickson in “The Six Demons of Emily Rose” turned every frame into a confession of faith and despair, “The Ravine” will be a reminder: even the deepest abyss is empty if you don't put meaning into it.
