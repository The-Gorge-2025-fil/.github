The movie “The Ravine” is a thrilling romantic thriller that combines elements of sci-fi, action and drama.  
Director Scott Derrickson, known for his works “Sinister” and “Dr. Strange”, created a unique story about love, duty and supernatural threats.  

The main characters are Levi (Miles Teller), a former Marine and elite sniper, and Drasa (Anya Taylor-Joy), a Lithuanian sniper in the service of Moscow. 
They are tasked by an unnamed organization: to guard opposite sides of a mysterious gorge that hides an unknown danger in its fog. Their mission is to patrol the area, maintain automatic machine guns and mine barriers, preventing the exit of mysterious creatures known as “hollow men”. 
Contact between them is strictly forbidden, but loneliness and curiosity lead Levi and Drasa to begin communicating through signs and binoculars, gradually developing romantic feelings. 
Their bond becomes the only bright spot in a dark and dangerous environment. However, when the creatures from the gorge begin active attacks, the heroes have to join forces to survive and prevent a global catastrophe. 
In the process, they uncover the secrets of a mysterious laboratory at the bottom of the gorge where experiments were conducted to create super soldiers, which leads to unexpected and dramatic consequences.
